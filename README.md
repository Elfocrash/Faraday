# Faraday
A (kinda opinionated) DynamoDB SDK that doesn't hate you and everything you ever loved

## Project summary

This is basically a spiritual successor to my previous project [Cosmonaut](https://github.com/Elfocrash/Cosmonaut). I had a lot of fun working on that project by I am sadly not working with Cosmos DB actively anymore so I cannot really maintain something that I am not using and since the latest SDK updates have fixed a lot of the things that Cosmonaut was fixing, there was no point to continuing the project.

Nowadays I am working with DynamoDB and boy, if you though the Cosmos DB v2 SDK was bad you definately haven't worked with the DynamoDB SDK (or any AWS SDK for .NET to be honest).
The goal of this project is allow me to use DynamoDB in .NET without feeling like the SDK hates me.

## Samples
* The `samples` folder contains a few sample projects that show what I have in mind in terms of how Faraday should feel to use
